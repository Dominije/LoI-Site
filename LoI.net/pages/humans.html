    <div class="container">
       <h2 style="color:#42CE04">Congrats you are now a Human of Legion Of Immortals , welcome to the family :D</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5">
                <img src="/img/human1.png" style="height:350px;width:450px"/>

                <h2 style="color:#42CE04">Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>The main reason we have humans in the clan is for people who are not sure or not ready for the responsibilities of being a Vampire or Lycan yet. When you are new to second life as we all know it's difficult to learn everything, so we would really like you to settle in and get to know how everything works before choosing to become a Vampire or Lycan and make sure its the right decision for you. Another function for humans in the clan is to act as blood dolls, but this is totally a personal preference, your body before you are bitten holds 5 liters of blood which equates to 100% humanity</p>

                <p>Vampires and Lycans lose a small amount of blood or lumens every midnight so they have to drink to keep from becoming destroyed. When a vampire bites you, you lose 5% of humanity per bite, if your humanity gets to 0% you become Revenant (this will only happen if you own the Thirst/Rage HUD, NOT the Human HUD). To prevent this from happening you can eat a bloodlines apple. One apple will give you 5% humanity back so roughly you need 1 apple per bite, this should be given to you by the person who bites you BEFORE they bite you. You can let whoever you like bite you but this is totally up to you, you are NOT obligated feed anyone, and do not let anyone tell you so. You can also drink from a cider tank if you want to fill up on large amounts of humanity at once.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7">
                <h2 style="color:#42CE04">*Choosing to become a Vampire or Lycan.</h2>
                <p>So you have become a blood doll & want to take the next step into becoming a vampire or lycan. We personally would not recommend people turn vampire or lycan until they are at least aÂ  couple weeks old in bloodlines, but this is a personal preference.</p>

                <p>If you want to become a vampire you can always get yourself a head start as it can be pricey game to play, with tank costs ranging from 299L-8000L in various sizes of 5Litres - 100Litres. It is not required that you have your own tanks as we provide them in all the turning rooms as well as provide free blood and lumens for the family if you can't afford it yourself.</p>
                
                <p>Also Tools that are worth having are The Spike, The Rampage claw & Soul Reaper these are all 499L each:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Spike and The Rampage Claw are very handy tool to have they allow you to drain blood or lumens in large amounts rather than doing several bites or attacks.</li>
                    <li>Soul Reapers are a useful tool but only used for trading Souls.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="color:#42CE04">Ranking and Advancement</h2>

                <p>Ranking up in the Legion is a combination of your level of involvement and how much you help with the various activities and aspects of clan life, and your bloodlines stats.</p>

                <p>There are things you can work on yourself to improve your stats if you feel you want to improve them in a way other than becoming a vampire or lycan and starting out hunting, the best option is working on your achievements and your soul rarity.</p>
                <ul>
	                <li>Achievements challenges within the Bloodlines game, each with multiple levels, and every Achievement you complete earns you badge icon on your profile. Here at Legion of Immortals we can help you complete some of these achievements; ask for help through the form on the achievements page, or in the in-world group!</li>
	
	                <li>Soul Rarity is basically a measure of your Bloodlines accomplishments. The more "rare" and valuable your soul is, the more you've accomplished in the game. When you join bloodlines, you start out with your soul being Common, and can progress to having your soul be Legendary. Several factors contribute to this such as the amount of Bloodlines tools you own, your royalty status in the bloodlines game (I.e. Impaler/Countess), how long you have played, and how many achievements you have completed. This all is tallied up in a point system that determines your soul's rarity.</li>
