       <h2>You have just been turned into a Vampire. You are a new Vampire in Legion Of Immortals!!! Congratulations and Welcome to the Family!</h2>

                <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>As a vampire, it is your responsibility to keep track of your blood levels, and to try your hardest to stay an active playing Vampire.  You lose 0.25 litres of blood each night, as the clock strikes midnight. That is just one or two bites a day. If you know you're not going to be online for a few days, fill up. Your body can hold up to 5 litres of blood. (5 litres of blood will keep you from being a destroyed vampire for 20 days) If you become destroyed, don't worry, to regain vampire status, you just need to drink blood again, by either biting someone or drinking from a tank.</p>

                <p>Hunting for fresh blood is your main objective, and to learn as much as you can about being a good vampire.  Once you have learned enough about being a vampire, and you feel comfortable enough with your information, you can start recruiting your own minions. However, if you intend to recruit, you must teach your minions what you have learned, it is very irresponsible to bring your own minions into the family and leave them uneducated, ideally you should impart your own knowledge on them or make sure that they can attend the classes we have available throughout the week (If you want to see what's on when, check the "Schedule" page).</p>

                <h2>Things to Remember</h2>
                <p>Your liege is your first line of contact if you have a question, problem, etc., please IM them first. If they are not available, please follow the chain of command and someone will help guide you.</p>

                <p>If your liege becomes destroyed, then your soul gets sent into the Abyss If this should happen, please contact one of the clan's guardians right away (if you aren't sure you know a guardian, you can go to our "Contacts" page here on the website). We will do all that we can to rescue you, and if needed place you with a more responsible liege.</p>
                <p>*UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ACCEPT TO DRINK ANY POTIONS FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN A TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE LEGION OF IMMORTALS FAMILY.*</p>

                <h2>Ranking and Advancement</h2>

                <p>Ranking up in the Legion is a combination of your level of involvement and how much you help with the various activities and aspects of clan life, and your bloodlines stats.</p>

                <p>There are things you can work on yourself to improve your stats if you feel you want to improve them in a way other than hunting, is working on your achievements and your soul rarity.</p>
                <ul>
	                <li>Achievements challenges within the Bloodlines game, each with multiple levels, and every Achievement you complete earns you badge icon on your profile. Here at Legion of Immortals we can help you complete some of these achievements; ask for help through the form on the achievements page, or in the in-world group!</li>
	
	                <li>Soul Rarity is basically a measure of your Bloodlines accomplishments. The more "rare" and valuable your soul is, the more you've accomplished in the game. When you join bloodlines, you start out with your soul being Common, and can progress to having your soul be Legendary. Several factors contribute to this such as the amount of Bloodlines tools you own, your royalty status in the bloodlines game (I.e. Impaler/Countess), how long you have played, and how many achievements you have completed. This all is tallied up in a point system that determines your soul's rarity.</li>
